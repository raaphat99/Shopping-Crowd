                        <h3>Brand Story</h3>
                        <p>At EcoGoods, our journey began in a small garage with a passion for sustainability.
                            Frustrated by the lack of eco-friendly options, our founder, Sarah, decided to take matters
                            into her own hands. Armed with determination and a vision, she started sourcing products
                            that aligned with her values: quality, environmental consciousness, and community support.
                        </p>
